Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This repository contains all the code and resources for my portfolio, where I showcase my journey, projects, and skills in web development and cybersecurity.

## 🚀 About Me

I am a passionate student and tech enthusiast with a focus on web development and cybersecurity. Currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, I am building a solid foundation to move on to React and Django for full-stack development. I love to experiment, create fun projects, and learn new technologies along the way.

## 🌐 Website

- **Live Site:** [im-amal-raj.github.io/portfolio](https://im-amal-raj.github.io/portfolio)

Built as a static site using custom HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. No complex frameworks or exhaustive effects—just clean code, performance, and personal flair.

## 🎨 Inspiration

The design, scroll flow, and visual style for this site were inspired by [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com/). The reference served as a guiding idea for layout and effects—I coded everything independently and did not use any of their actual code or assets.  
*Special thanks to Brittany Chiang for her inspiring portfolio!*
